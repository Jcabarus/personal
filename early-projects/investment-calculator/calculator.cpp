        Make something from this example, I invested $20 to a stock that sells $0.50/share.
        I want to make $100 from the investment, I want to find out what $/share of the stock will be to make $100.
        I would also like to know if I bought 100 shares, how much will that cost me if the stock is $0.50/share.
